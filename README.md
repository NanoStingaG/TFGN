Code for the semi-automation of the analisis of the free surface output from Maxsurf Resistance

It consists of a unique file "script-analisis-sup-libre.py", in python language, and divided in cells. 
The first two cells organise the data extracted from Maxsurf Resistance, while the third does all the calculation. 
To use the script properly, follow the next steps:

1. Paste the file path of the raw data, which is in .txt format. Running the first cell you convert all the files to .xlsx.
2. Specify a path for the output file in the second cell, named in the script as raw-transformed.
3. Run the third cell, after pasting in the code the path of raw-transformed. You will need to insert the output path as well, named as out-transformed in the script.

Following all these steps you get to analyse the free surface extracted from Maxsurf Resistance!
